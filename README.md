# Skill Recommendation System

## Overview

The Skill Recommendation System is a web application designed to recommend skills to users based on their existing skill sets and the skill sets of similar users. Utilizing a collaborative filtering approach, the system leverages cosine similarity to analyze user profiles and suggest new skills that can enhance their professional capabilities. This project aims to provide personalized skill recommendations, making it easier for users to identify areas for improvement and expand their expertise.

## Features

- **Skill Recommendation**: Provides skill recommendations based on the skills of similar users.
- **User Management**: Allows adding new users with their existing skills and receiving tailored recommendations.
- **Similarity Scoring**: Calculates similarity scores between users based on their assigned skills.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes pickle files to store and retrieve user skills and similarity scores efficiently.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: 
  - **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, particularly cosine similarity.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Standard web technologies for the user interface.
  
- **Data Storage**:
  - **CSV**: For storing initial skill data.
  - **Pickle**: For persisting DataFrames containing user skills and similarity scores.
